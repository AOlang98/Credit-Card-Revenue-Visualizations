# Credit Card Revenue Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting credit card revenue through a comprehensive analysis of credit card transaction data. Leveraging Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the project explores insightful visualizations to understand trends, patterns, and key factors influencing revenue. Additionally, machine learning techniques, including linear regression, are employed to build predictive models. The trained models are saved using joblib and stored in the 'models' directory. The project provides a detailed exploration of the data, visualizations for interpretation, and a framework for predicting credit card revenue based on transaction features.

## Project Structure

- **datasets:** Contains the datasets used in the project, including raw and processed data.

- **notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step analyses, visualizations, and model development. Clearly labeled notebooks provide insights into the data exploration, visualization, and machine learning aspects of the project.
